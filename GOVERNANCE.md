# Process for becoming a maintainer

* Express interest to the project leader that you are interested in becoming a
  maintainer. Becoming a maintainer generally means that you are going to be spending substantial
  time (>20%) on BFE for the foreseeable future. You are expected to have domain expertise and be extremely
  proficient in golang. 
* We will expect you to start contributing increasingly complicated PRs, under the guidance
  of the existing senior maintainers.
* We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog. As you gain experience with the code base and our standards, 
  we will ask you to do code reviews for incoming PRs.
* After a period of approximately 3 months of working together and making sure we see eye to eye,
  the existing senior maintainers will confer and decide whether to grant maintainer status or not.
  We make no guarantees on the length of time this will take, but 3 months is an approximate
  goal.


# Maintainer responsibilities

* Classify GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.

* During GitHub issue classification, apply all applicable [labels](https://github.com/baidu/bfe/labels)
  to each new issue. Labels are extremely useful for follow-up of future issues. Which labels to apply
  is somewhat subjective so just use your best judgment. 

* Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them if they are not
  moving in a productive direction.

* Participate when called upon in the security release process. Note
  that although this should be a rare occurrence, if a serious vulnerability is found, the process
  may take up to several full days of work to implement.

* In general continue to be willing to spend at least 20% of your time working on BFE (1 day per week).


# When does a maintainer lose maintainer status

* If a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. 

* In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of the maintainers per the voting process. The voting 
process is a simple majority in which each seniormaintainer receives two votes and each normal maintainer 
receives one vote.
